You have 5 minutes to complete any of the following tasks. Otherwise git reset –hard after 5 min:

    Write a failing test (Only task where a failing test is allowed)
    Make a failing test pass
    Refactor
    Think (You cannot repeat this task)
    Hints if you cannot make progress in 2 minutes this is usually due to:
        You are trying to achieve too much, break your work into smaller steps
        The code base is in bad shape, you probably need to refactor before moving forward.

Rules:

Players alternate placing X’s and O’s on a 3x3 board,
with X starting first
Players cannot play on already taken positions

A player wins when it has three symbols  in a row, either
Horizontally
Vertically 
Diagonally

If all squares are taken and there are not three symbols in a row, than the outcome is a draw

Caveat: try to make invalid state unrepresentable
